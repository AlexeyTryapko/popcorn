      `I have seen this film twice in the last two days, I probably will see it many more times.Tarantino has shocked and surprised me before, but this was the biggest shock of all. The movie is set in the Hollywood of 1969, just before the brutal Manson family murders. Leonard Dicaprio and Brad Pitt give career high performances. Dicaprio is Rick Dalton, a TV cowboy actor who longs for movie stardom but has now hit the skids. Pitt plays Cliff Booth his stunt double/driver and all around best bud. They also represent doubles of each other in real life, though Dalton is angry and frustrated at his failings in life while Booth is perfectly happy to be his pal's gopher and handyman. There is good recreations of TV westerns of the time, Dalton had been the star of Bounty Law a show that never existed but is clearly based on Steve McQueen's "Wanted Dead Or Alive" series. Dalton is now playing guest role villains on TV. An actual series "Lancer" is recreated here, I never saw this show when it aired since it was on up against "The Mod Squad" in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Dalton has some funny and touching scenes opposite a precocious 8 year old actress while doing the "Lancer" episode. The late Luke Perry has his final film appearance in these scenes also. Margot Robbie has an almost magical presence playing actress Sharon Tate. Tate unfortunately is best known today as the most famous of the Manson family murder victims. We see not only how beautiful she was but also how good and kind she was as well. One of my favorite scenes is when she goes to a movie theater to watch "The Wrecking Crew" a film she made in 1968 with Dean Martin. We see actual clips of the movie, (with the real Sharon Tate) and cuts back to her reactions, she becomes delighted when the audience laughs at her comedy bits and applauds at her fight scene with Nancy Kwan. The film starts to turn dark when Cliff picks up a teenage girl hitchhiker who wants to be taken to Spahn Ranch, a run down movie set where he once worked. I have read nearly everything about the Manson case, so I knew where it was going now. Cliff sees a bunch of mostly hippie girls hanging around and asks if George Spahn the original owner of the ranch still lives there. The scenes at the ranch are quietly disturbing. Dakota Fanning (I did not recognize her) plays Squeaky, one of the real life Manson girls. Her vacant eyes and cold manner make for some suspenseful moments. Cliff is concerned about his old friend George and demands to see him. He finds him now old and blind (Bruce Dern in a great cameo) but at least alive. Cliff is still suspicious but leaves the ranch. The final act comes up for the biggest shock of all. Rick has returned from several months filming some spaghetti westerns in Italy.He has also gotten married to an Italian actress. It is now August 8 1969. Cliff and his faithful pit bull Brandy are staying the night at Rick's house. Sharon Tate and some of her friends arrive at her home (which is right next door to Rick) to spend the evening together. Then Manson followers Charles "Tex" Watson, Patricia "Katie" Krenwinkel, Susan "Sadie" Atkins and Linda Kasabian are driving up the road. I knew what was coming and was dreading this moment, I was hoping that Tarantino would not show the gruesome murders but I was preparing myself. Then Rick hears them driving up and has an angry altercation with them, then I was a bit surprised that real life characters were suddenly intermingling with fictional characters on a night when a horrible historic moment happened. When Rick goes into the house, the killers suddenly realize that he was the star of the TV show "Bounty Law". Then psycho Sadie goes on a rant about how TV showed her generation how to kill by showing murders every week on the small screen. I had heard some Manson followers had actually said this. Linda is too scared to go with the other three and takes the car keys and drives off leaving them. Another change in the real story, Linda did not participate in the murders but did stay with them, so once again I am getting bewildered. Tex, Sadie and Katie than decide to go to Rick's house rather than Sharon's. I am wondering are they now going to kill them also? Then the most surprising thing happens, Cliff, his pit bull and Rick decide to fight back against these scummy creeps leaving them to be battered and massacred. Brandy has some great scenes as one of the most heroic dogs I have seen in film. My head was reeling by this time, I kept thinking "Are they really doing this?" Then came the ending, Rick is now safe, Cliff injured but alive. And now Rick gets to meet his next door neighbor Sharon and her friends. I am still in shock but then for the first time we see the title on screen "Once Upon A Time... In Hollywood" and then I finally get it, this is a Hollywood story not real life, this is what we wish would have happened. I finally had to see the film again for a second time so I could actually enjoy that climatic scene, without the dread and confusion I had the first time. This is a phenomenal work, like nothing I have ever seen and probably never will again.`,
      `I don't typically leave IMDb reviews but this film deserves so much praise for its risky screenplay in such a dark true crime setting. For 2 hrs, 41 minutes, I was taken 50 years back, experiencing Hollywood's film industry as a comedic drama filled with desire, tension and everyday life. I liked Brad's character the most, but Leo easily matched with his own performance. A definite see-it-in-theatres watch. Bring your sense of humor though. There are lines of dialogue and laugh out loud bits that completely satisfy your curious mind. Expect everything you would from Tarantino, but also what you wouldn't. I gave it a perfect 10 because I forgot I was watching a nearly 3 hour film, even though it still wasn't long enough for me. I would like to see a director's cut up to an hour longer as I think this is a unique case that extra footage would only help such an already powerful story. I had the privilege to watch an early 70mm screening of this film at the cinerama dome with the director, Tarantino, in the audience. It was a surreal experience I'll never forget.`,
      `Here's why not everyone will like this movie: it's not like all of Tarantino's other movies, and it's not like any modern movies either. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is a melancholy, slow burning, comedic love letter to an age of Hollywood that we find ourselves disconnect from nowadays. The point of this movie isn't to be just like Pulp Fiction and tell stories that have no meaning. In fact, I would argue that Tarantino wants each and every story to have a meaning. Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a faded action star struggling to hold onto his career and fame. Every scene he was in was enjoyable, as he internally argues with himself to be better than he is. He can't find work except for as a typecast villain, and turns down an offer to go overseas initially because he thinks it's too far a step down from his past career. Dalton's story was not as fun to me as his stunt double, Cliff Booth's (Brad Pitt), but I will get to that in a minute. Dalton's story, some will say, was boring, overdrawn, and pointless. I say it was the most important and interesting storyline in the movie. Rick is an alcoholic, and deals with a lot of anger towards himself, particularly in his trailer (you'll see what I mean), and the long scenes showing him act out his part as the villain in the western are extremely entertaining as DiCaprio does some brilliant work letting us see Dalton as an actor without losing touch with him by slipping into acting of his own. He finally decides to go overseas, but most of that time is spent in a montage. When he returns, he dons a new Italian wife and an entirely new fashion straight from Europe. He doesn't do much towards the end, except for burn a manson follower alive in his pool, and then he finally becomes friends with his neighbors. I'll also get to that when I talk about Sharon Tate. Rick is representative of Hollywood at the time of 1969, and unless you are familiar with film history, that will be lost on you. In 1969 movies like Easy Rider, Bonnie and Clyde, and The Graduate were changing the face of Cinema by eroding censorship codes and finally getting the studios to hand the reigns to directors, thus entering the age of auterism. Actors like Rick were becoming absolete in film for a number of reasons, but mainly that they hadn't had to search for work whilst under the studio system, they just signed a contract and found work immediately. Roman Polanski, his neighbor, was one of the directors that was now given a lot of free reign in this age, . Dalton's character expressed the frustration many probably felt at the time, and Tarantino built a character that was beautifully acted by DiCaprio. Cliff Booth on the other hand, was the most Tarantino character in the movie. I think he'll be the fan favorite, because he requires no historical context or empathy to understand. He's a stunt double who lives much worse than his star, Dalton, and is a no-no sense badass with a muddled past. His scenes were incredibly fun, as Pitt brought a certain energy to each scene that glued you to the screen waiting for his next move. Particularly at the end, when Tex had him at gunpoint and he was tripping on acid. Obviously he had the situation under control, but we as the audience have no idea until he sicks the dog on them. Booth was a character you expect to see in a Tarantino movie. None of his storyline was used for what people will say is "pointless", mainly because he is the most involved with the Manson clan. Interestingly, the Manson clan is hardly shown in the movie. Charles himself only shows up twice, and only says a few words. I actually like this choice, because it left a lingering thought that perhaps Manson was a danger at all times, and didn't play to the audience the way we thought it would. It wasn't a story about the Manson murders. Manson just happened to be going on at the time Dalton and Booth were having their struggles, and it intersected. Which brings me to my last point, and that is of Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie). Her role, while a tad less utilized than I expected, was Central because the real life Tate was murdered by the Manson clan. If you go in as an audience member with that knowledge, you go the whole movie waiting for something to happen to her, and it never does. Tate herself was a happy, blooming actress who spent time with friends and danced (a lot). This carefree manner was underlying a want to be famous, as she tells people who she is and is clearly disappointed when they don't recognize her. Tate plays a role in this story of showing the era of actors now replacing Rick Dalton, and also showing special to Hollywood, the silver screen's allure. As this is essentially a long love letter to Hollywood, Tarantino pens what drew him to the screen through Tate. With all of its references, obscure or in your face, there is a delicious amount to absorb, especially for cinefiles. Tarantino has the viewer to sit back, eat up the screen, and imagine we are right there with the characters in a wonderfully painted portrait of a Hollywood long gone. This movie will be misunderstood because of the expectations for the Manson murders, and because audiences nowadays expect action on every corner, which Tarantino's name can be attached to in some capacity. Without any crazy special effects to speak, simply a fantastic script and acting, I think many audience members will get bored or not understand why it's entertaining to others. I personally think it's one of Tarantino's best, if not his absolute best, and will stand the test of time for movie lovers everywhere. Agree or disagree, we all have to admit that Brad Pitt's dog was awesome.`,
      `Another great Tarantino film, though I do agree there are times where it feels a little indulgent and meandering. The climax of the film is fantastic though, and it does make it feel like it was all worth it for the most part. There isn't really a defined narrative, which may put some people off but Tarantino's sublime dialogue and the great performances make all of the scenes at least entertaining. It's no Pulp Fiction, but it definitely is one of the most original films I've seen in a while.`,
      `Just got out of a screening. This movie was perfection to me! Everything plays a part in the experience. This is some of the best acting I have seen in a long time. I was swept away with the look, music, and story. The best part of this movie is when you are spending time with these characters. Rick Dalton has quickly become on of my favorite characters of all time! Leo lights the screen on fire every time we are with him. He is the ultimate package in this by giving Rick so much depth. Pitt does an amazing job as well. Cliff Booth would be a guy I would want to hang out with. It's nice to see a movie about two guy friends that support one another in different facets of life. It is so much deeper than some sort of average buddy cop affair. Margo Robbie gets a shout out too. She truly embodies Sharon Tate and glows on screen. She is amazing. This is Tarantino at the height of his powers. He gets the best performance out of everyone in every part of this movie. There are a lot of very enjoyable smaller parts in this. It's also great to see him working with the second generation of actors and actresses he has worked with in the past. I was taken on a ride to every part of Hollywood in this. From the glitz and glamour to the dark and twisted. This movie has a really awesome third act that I wouldn't dream of spoiling. I consider it a cherry on top of an already perfect movie. The directing, writing, music, cinematography, acting were all on point. It's a slow burn but all in all this movie is about Hollywood and the different aspects of it. The rising and falling of it's movie stars, and the people that flock to it in hopes of a different life. Go in with an open mind and let the movie take you on it's ride and you won't be disappointed.`,
      `Tarantino at his best, in rare form. Dicaprio and Pitt acted their faces off. Its funny smart and original in a world of remakes and comic book films. A true new Masterpiece.`,
      `I just got in from watching Once Upon a Time In Hollywood. I've been a Quentin Tarantino fan since, well, Reservoir Dogs. Amid his trademark over-the-top violence and gore, I have always felt he treats the art with a respect that's often lost in controversy. His execution of heartfelt homage is so authentic that it becomes his biggest criticism, and to the less astute, is often dismissed as blatant theft. Once Upon a Time In Hollywood is the homage of all homages. Critics are calling this Tarantino's "love letter to Hollywood", but in reality it's much, much more. This letter addresses a Hollywood that's no longer recognizable, and that melancholy is woven into the fabric of this film. While there is the requisite violence, witty banter, and unpredictable outcomes, this is probably the most mature and intelligent Quentin Tarantino film yet. It also deviates from the Tarantino template by remaining somewhat linear. With a runtime of just over two hours and forty minutes, the pacing is artfully throttled, allowing the audience to take in the authentic and painstakingly detailed scenery. The period music drives the narrative but never becomes a music video. The performances are flawless. Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt will deservedly receive accolades for their performances as the main characters, but honestly there is not a single weak performance among the ensemble. And lastly, the subject matter: I was admittedly apprehensive about how the events of August 8, 1969 would be handled. While no one would be surprised to see these heinous acts glorified or even caricatured, Tarantino continues to be unpredictable. At the risk of spoiling the plotline, I'll just say this is handled tastefully and even respectfully, yet true to the classic Tarantino flair. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood demonstrates a more mellowed Quentin Tarantino touch but it's far from a departure. I suspect audiences that normally can't stomach the assaulting violence and shock of the Tarantino brand may very well enjoy this film.`,
      `QT films are awful and couldn't see this movie fast enough. All I can say is what was that all about? It was so boring. Did anyone edit this film? Leonardo's character was not likable. The only person tolerable was Brad Pitt. Nothing happened what so ever. Don't watch! The dialogue was not clever. The movie never went anywhere at all. It was just endless scenes of other movies being made. Bad People driving in cars. Bare feet over kill. By the time the ending happened I didn't care anymore. I wanted to LOVE this movie, but I haven't been this bored in a long long time. I wish i felt differently.`,
      `It reminds me of that old fable. People go to see Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio in a film by Tarantino and assume it has to be great despite what they are actually seeing on the screen.. The film is incredibly slow paced and neither funny nor suspenseful. Throwing in a 5 minute fantasy violent scene at the end after over two hours of boredom did NOT make me change my mind.. Sadly disappointing to this fan of most Tarantino films.`,
      `Even great actors can't save this storyless plotless meandering piece of self-indulgent nostalgia. It looks like they had a great time making it and to heck wirh the audience. I love the old-time movie feel of most of QTs films, but come on, you need a plot. You need to tell a story. As QT famously said a movie should make you want to sit down over a piece of pie afterwards and talk about it. Soon as our group walked out all anyone had to say was how painfully boring and self-indulgent it was. That was it. QT you gave us nothing to talk about.`,
      `Greetings again from the darkness. Hippies, westerns, short skirts, pompadours, catchy pop songs ... all have (mostly) disappeared from our world. Back to save the day and the memories, and twist a little history, is Quentin Tarantino, the ultimate film geek. His latest reminds us of a bygone era of movie stars and old school filmmaking ... a once beloved industry which has been described as being on life support. There have been plenty of big screen love letters to Hollywood, but few if any, were filmed with so many personal touches and call-backs to the director's own films. In keeping with the request from Mr. Tarantino, this review will not include any spoilers or details that might negatively impact anyone's initial viewing of the film. It's a reasonable request since the film is so unique and literally packed with nostalgia, sight gags, and historical bits and pieces - some accurate, some not so much. There is a lot to take in and process, and the full impact of the initial viewing might result in awe, shock or disgust ... and maybe even all of the above. So this will be a pretty simple overview peppered with some insight that should enhance rather than spoil the experience. The film covers about 6 months in 1969, but in reality, it all takes place (at least what we see on screen) in 3 days. Leonardo DiCaprio (possibly his best ever performance) plays Rick Dalton, an actor who had a hit (fictional) TV western series in the 50's and 60's entitled "Bounty Law". Since the show ended, Rick has been unable to make the successful transition to movies. For comparison, think of Clint Eastwood, Steve McQueen and Burt Reynolds - all actors in TV westerns who found greater career success in movies. Brad Pitt (the epitome of cool) stars as Cliff Booth, Rick's stunt double, friend, driver, handyman, etc. While Rick is desperate to find the next stage of his career and fend off being forgotten, Cliff, a Vietnam vet, is accepting of his lot in life. Rick lives in a swanky Hollywood Hills home next door to hotshot director Roman Polanski and his starlet wife Sharon Tate; and Cliff lives in a trailer behind the Van Nuys Drive-In with his well-trained Rottweiler Brandy. There are multiple parallel stories to follow, and a key one involves the aforementioned Sharon Tate. Margot Robbie nails the role and bounces about town with the energy and sweet aura that we imagine she possessed. All 3 of the lead actors - DiCaprio, Pitt, Robbie - have knockout scenes that I'd love to be able to discuss, but I'm not sure how without giving away too much. What I can say is that each of these three talented actors prove that movie stars still exist. This is Tarantino's 9th film as a director (he counts the 2-part KILL BILL as one film), and he claims he will stop making films after number 10. There are multiple features we can count on in a QT film, and a ridiculously deep supporting cast is one. Going through each of the characters played by actors you will recognize would take a page and a half, so I'll cover only a few here. Margaret Qualley is a scene stealer as Pussycat, one of the Manson family girls. You likely remember her from the recent "Fosse/Verdon" or "The Leftovers", and here she fully embraces the hippie look and spirit. Emile Hirsch plays hairdresser Jay Sebring, one of those in the house with Ms. Tate on that fateful night, and Mike Moh plays Bruce Lee so convincingly that I was momentarily confused when he took off his sunglasses. Also making appearances are some Tarantino regulars: Kurt Russell (as a stunt coordinator and narrator), Michael Madsen (as an actor), and Bruce Dern as George Spahn (a late replacement after Burt Reynolds passed away). Others of note include Maya Hawke (Uma Thurman's daughter), Austin Butler (recently cast in the title role of Baz Luhrmann's Elvis biopic) as Tex Watson, Rumer Willis (Bruce's daughter) as actress Joanna Pettet, Damian Lewis as Steve McQueen, Al Pacino as agent Marvin Schwarzs, Dakota Fanning as Squeaky Fromme, and the late Luke Perry as actor Wayne Maunder ("Lancer"). 90 year old Clu Gulager ("The Virginian", THE LAST PICTURE SHOW) makes an appearance, and Nicholas Hammond (Friedrich from THE SOUND OF MUSIC) tears into his role with gusto as director Sam Wanamaker. There is even a TV Guide cover featuring the late great character actor Andrew Duggan ("Lancer"). Some of these, and many more, are like cameos, but it's still fascinating to see the faces. 1969 was 50 years ago, and Tarantino does a remarkable job of recreating the look of Sunset Boulevard, Hollywood Boulevard, Cielo Drive, and studio backlots. Much credit goes to Production Designer Barbara Ling and Set Decorator Nancy Haigh (frequent Coen Brothers collaborator and an Oscar winner for BUGSY). Arianne Phillips does a tremendous job with the costumes that look natural for the time period, and not like something right off the wardrobe racks. Three-time Oscar winning Cinematographer Robert Richardson (HUGO, THE AVIATOR, JFK) is back for his 6th Tarantino film, and he captures the look and feel and vibe of a time that is so personal to the director. It's been three and a half years since THE HATEFUL EIGHT, Tarantino's most recent film, and probably his worst received. This one is clearly personal as it captures the time and place that he fell in love with movies. The dichotomy of rising starlet and fading cowboy as neighbors is a brilliant way to make a point about times changing. This was a time of transition in the United States - a new culture was upon us, and whatever innocence remained, was surely snuffed out on a hot August night in 1969. As usual, his use of music serves a purpose. We are treated to Roy Head, The Royal Guardsmen, and Paul Revere and the Raiders, among others. QT also shows us plenty of bare feet (another trademark). What is unusual is that the film lacks the trademark mass dialogue. This one kind of meanders ... right up until it doesn't. Quentin Tarantino is a living, breathing film geek (that's a compliment) who has earned the right to make the movies he wants to make. This one took him a lifetime to live, 5 years to write, and it will take you 161 minutes to watch. It was warmly received at Cannes, but no one can expect to "catch" everything Mr. Tarantino has served up in one viewing. That said, one viewing will likely be one too many for quite a few folks (especially many under 40 who have no recollection of this Hollywood). Some will categorize this as an overindulgent nostalgia trip for movie nerds. And they are likely correct. But for those of us who complain that too many movies are remakes, re-treads and comic books, there is no denying Tarantino delivers a unique and creative viewing experience - and it's not meant for everyone.`,
      `Tarantino's best. By the end of the film, I was literally crying. Bittersweet, really. Best ending I've seen in a while. I especially loved the true-grit nature of Brad Pitt's character (and his dog). And kudos to the rest of the cast, including DiCaprio, who flexed his considerable acting talent, and also to the young lady (Julia Butters) who played an eight-year-old actress on one of the sets. The music, costumes, makeup, sets, and locations totally nailed the era. The whole crew did a great job. I will watch this movie again; I loved it that much. (BTW, I don't know if everyone in the audience 'got' the film. My advice, if you're not super familiar with the Charles Manson story, is to watch the 2004 Helter Skelter TV film or read the book Helter Skelter.)`,
      `While I generally love Tarantino films, "Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood" left me cold. I was expecting something great. Instead he gives us a bit of a mess filled with forced 1960s references, really forced, unlike "American Graffiti" which just melded them into the fabric of the film. Even the afterscene was forced and certainly not worth waiting for. Yes the acting was generally pretty darned good. Yes, the camera work was dazzling. But the film just seemed superficial and artificial. I realize there are plenty of folks who just adored the film and concluded it was innovative and clever beyond belief. I fear those conclusions are as superficial as this film. So if you're a fan of Tarrantino films, this could go either way for you. If you don't buy into the hype, you very well may enjoy it. But iIf you're not a fan of his films, this one isn't likely to turn you into a fan. Better you should rent "Reservoir Dogs."`,
      `I went to see this movie on opening day. Even as a giant Quinten fan, I was surprised to see an 8.9 rating for this on IMDb. I'm further surprised and saddened to see that Hollywood still hires people to write fake reviews. I don't think they realize that people are waking up and seeing through the hype and the nonsense. And I was looking forward to this movie for two years. I followed this movie throughout its production. I fell for the trailer. I was excited to see Bruce Lee. I really went into this movie wanting to have a good time. But 90 minutes in, I was still waiting for the film to start. Evey scene I thought, "oh this is where he should've started it..."'That's a bad sign.`,
      `'Once Upon a Time . . .' continues Tarantino's decline as a writer and director, although the principal weakness of his latest film is a rambling screenplay which develops neither story nor characters. Set in LA at the time of the notorious Manson Family murders, the relationship between fading alcoholic TV star Rick, and his long-time stunt double Cliff takes center stage. Unfortunately the pair share a commonplace connection, neither man has much personality and their exchanges never hint at the electricity between Vincent and Jules in 'Pulp Fiction', or Louis and Ordell in 'Jackie Brown'. The movie looks decent enough, but oodles of time is wasted venerating the trashy TV shows and films of that period. There are two interminable episodes where Rick delivers some routine over-acting as a villainous cowboy in a formulaic TV pilot, intercut with Sharon Tate visiting a cinema to watch a spoof spy movie in which she had a minor role. More than a hundred minutes are spent on a procession of similarly inconsequential set pieces which do little more than provide background. Eventually, the ghostly apparition of an actual story emerges after Cliff gives one of Manson's underage hippie runaways a ride to the derelict movie ranch where the 'Family' were residing. The ensuing confrontation shows the potential of Tarantino's idea - but he loses the plot again in order to pay homage to spaghetti westerns. Voice-overs laboriously explain the narrative gaps until the 'action' finally arrives at an absurd climax which gives Tarantino yet another opportunity to show off his chops as a director of theatrical violence. He gives reality a fairy tale tweak in this last act, but overall the chief impression is of self-indulgence and superficiality.`,
      `I don't know how to describe what I felt during the movie, I had a constant smile for the fantastic locations, for the fantastic camera movements, the well-constructed and dynamic dialogues, and Oscar-worthy actorial performances. It's not a movie for everyone, but if you love cinema, the art of filmmaking and storytelling, you'll love this movie. In addition it is one of the few films that after having seen it, you think about it for days and you always want to go deeper and watch it several times. Just wonderful.`,
      `I can't believe all the high reviews for this film. While the acting was fine, there is no plot.. When you go see a QT film you expect great dialog, interesting characters and a craziness that only QT provides. This didn't have any of it. It seems liberal Hollywood has cut the balls of QT. This was as boring and dull as you can get. By the time the ending comes, and you get maybe 5 minutes of classic QT it doesn't matter anymore. Very disappointed.`,
      `Awful job by a great talent! Not engaging in the least. Poorly executed and disjointed, with no plot. Waste of a talented cast too. The most interesting part of the film was the 3 people in my row snoring through it. QT...sorry buddy...but a phone in.`,
      `People will say it's a great, fantastic, masterpiece film from Tarantino, but truth be told it's just simply terrible and boring with pointless scenes scattered throughout. If I'm wrong, this film will sell millions of blue-rays so people can watch it over and over again and still be highly rated in years to come. .........but I doubt it after the dust settles`,
      `If you want to see a movie don't go to this. I'm not sure it can be classified as entertainment because it was SO slow and fragmented. No story line and no real plot. It was just a bunch of loosely strung together boring dialogue. The saddest thing was relying on the death of a beautiful women to get its publicity. QT of course is all about sadistic, bloody, violence and here he didn't disappoint. But it was poorly written, poorly paced, and poorly directed. At least the actors tried but they had NOTHING to work with. I want my money back. Oh, by the way, the ending is ludicrous an stupid.`,
      `2:45 mins of crap. There is no storyline, random crap everywhere and it makes me cringe to watch it. The only entertaining part of this movie is the last 15 mins. Otherwise this is absolutely nonsensical.! I don't understand what great actors like Leo and Brad were thinking when they agreed to be a part of this God forsaken movie. Respect and love for them but this movie just sucks!`,
      `This is absolutely my new favorite movie of all time. The performance, the plot, the tones in the film. Everything just works together and I cannot imagine it any better. You either hate the movie or you love it. Brad Pitt and Leonardo Decaprio have a beautiful bromance and Margot Robbie plays Sharon Tate to the T. Even the way the movie was filmed the angles and scenes were just jaw dropping. The car scene at the beginning definitely sets the tone and the Easter eggs pay homage to the final days of the Golden age of Hollywood. I highly highly suggest watching a documentary on the Manson Family if you're not familiar with the story because There are subtle shots throughout the movie and characters that play major role in the plot and the actual real events that you would not catch. The ending was just fantastic and Brad Pitt nailed it. It might be slow for some people but for me the pacing was perfect even with the actual events the Manson Family cult started off as peace love hippies and Charles Manson over the years turned on Hollywood after they rejected him for his failed music career which correlates with the narrative. You have to know the story to get the movie. But yeah the movie was absolutely brilliant and incredible acting.`,
      `Absolutely loved every minute of this movie. Usually I'm not too crazy about Tarantino's movies, but this one is definitely the best one I've seen in a long time. The actors were picked perfectly. The overall experience of a movie is amazing. When we first went to watch it, I was a bit skeptical and thought I'd end up leaving an hour into the movie (it's a 3 hr movie), but it grabbed my attention from the very beginning and I didn't even wanna get up to go to the bathroom, afraid to miss something. I'm usually very particular about the movies, nothing can hardly satisfy me, but this one is definitely in the top 5. Soundtrack was perfect. When I got home, I've done some more research on it and loved it even more! Overall, I would highly recommend this film!`,
      `No one to blame but myself for giving this one a look; got just what I deserved, too. Unlike, say, GHOST DOG: WAY OF THE SAMURAI or THE MAN WITH THE IRON FISTS, DJANGO UNCHAINED doesn't seem as much like a filmmaker paying homage to what has come before as grave robbing. Sure, everybody does it, but the two aforementioned movies were done with a bit more genuine love, it seems, than this one. Scenes drag on interminably (THIS script won an Academy Award???), which is bad enough, but my biggest gripe has to be the PERFORMANCES. I don't know who the lead actor is (nor do I care), but he reminded me of the actors in movies like THE LOST SKELETON OF CADAVERA and SIX STRING SAMURAI: he's clearly an actor doing his lines- nothing more; we never, at any point in the pointless proceedings, feel like he IS the character. The scene where we see Django's djunk was more than a tad odd: the actor holding said djunk does so gently, and releases the djunk carefully. I'd be willing to bet that that was co-star Jaime Foxx's favorite day on the set... (Ah, to be cradled in the loving hands of a caring director...)`,
      `Although very well made, I honestly can't say its been a pleasure watching this. In fact, there are not enough adjectives to use to describe how I loathed this film. I watched this in utter disgust and hated EVERY minute. Also, how many times must I hear the word n***** in one film?? Wait, what?? Calvin Candie (DiCaprio jumps to conclusions because of an ASSUMPTION made by Stephen (Samuel L Jackson) before obtaining ANY facts and this leads to gunfight galore??? THIS is supposed to be where it gets interesting??? Two hours into the film when most films end??? What the bloody hell! And it took almost 3 hours to tell this story?? My ONLY positive comment goes to Christoph Waltz, who was excellent in this film. The film won numerous awards. Yeah, blah-blah, who cares...`,
      `Tarantino's latest, Django Unchained, reminds those of us - well, those of you - who had, perhaps, forgotten that at the end of the day cinema is essentially about making a fast buck by getting as many bums on seats as you can before you flog off the DVD rights. Certainly individual directors, actors and producers like to be involved in something which is a little less like selling your arse to the highest bidder, but when the chips are down making a mountain of moolah, and then some, is the name of the game. That is the only way I can explain the abysmal, insulting mess that is Django Unchained. If you thought Inglourious Basterds - whose USP was the existence of a vastly successful Jewish death squad sticking it to the Nazis in occupied France - was as bad as I did, Django Unchained won't persuade you that Tarantino has regained his touch. In fact, with notable exceptions, for example Jackie Brown, you find yourself wondering whether he actually did have a touch in the first place and whether perhaps it was more beginner's luck. Tarantino's latest, I read somewhere, is a paean to B movies, and from the cheesy music to the the sudden close-up zoom he uses you can see that the man did, perhaps, have something like that in mind. So the obvious question is: why on earth bother? Is a meal of greasy, second-rate badly cooked food any better if you declare it is a paean to fast food? Why on earth did Christoph Waltz, Leonardo Di Caprio, Morgan Freeman and Jamie Foxx allow themselves to become involved in these campest of drearily camp capers? What was Tarantino trying to do? I ask because it really isn't obvious. At times his film comes across as a comedy (although the scene of the Ku Klux Klan complaining that they can't see where they are going because the eyeholes cut out of the white bags they are wearing won't let them is about as funny as a wet day in Dudley. Oh, and the Klan weren't even founded until seven years after the events of this film are said to take place. That kind of sloppiness permeates the film. There's also an inexplicable scene set in bright sunshine although we are supposed to be in winter, and the previous and subsequent scenes show deep, deep snow. And where did those snow-capped mountains come from in Texas?). The first hour is reasonably intriguing but then the decline sets in and the final scene is so ludicrously bad, you forget that earlier the film had to a certain extent held your interest, if only out of some vague curiosity as to where it was all heading. The blood flows with abandon, of course, and although it is gratuitous, it is no worse than other films (for example, a scene in The Cabin In The Woods). But not for the first time I have wondered about Tarantino's sexual psyche: he does seem to emphasise pain and gore a great deal. Is that perhaps how he gets his sexual jollies? But what the hell. This film will probably clear up at the box office because there is a sufficient number of idiots out there who are willing to sit through dross like this. But my advice to anyone who considering giving this a whirl is: don't bother. This so far has an average rating of 8.7. Don't let that fool you. It is terrible.`,
      `Tarantino's third casting choice Jamie Foxx plays Django, a freed slave on a quest to rescue his woman from a plantation owner played by DiCaprio. The aim of the movie is to satirize the Spaghetti western and blaxploitation film and the way to achieve this, apparently, is to botch the entire thing as humanly possible as to make the end result so unwatchable, no one in their right minds could offer a serious critique anymore. The film consists primarily of intentionally bad shoot-em-up scenes, superfluous dialog, outrageous yet totally unwitty cinematic clichés, lousy editing and ridiculous cameos. The soundtrack has to be heard to be believed. The heap of adolescent nonsense Tarantino has been writing/directing over the last decade or so fails to meet any expectations one might have had after seeing Pulp Fiction almost 20 years ago. Quentin's films have been so consistently and distinctly inferior compared to that masterpiece, they can hardly be considered disappointments anymore.`,

      `This movie is unwatchable for those who value human life and take a stand in opposition to extreme violence as art. I found myself having to endure it as a compromise group movie choice. I walked out. Spattering blood everywhere is not art. Art is not coming up with new and shocking ways to kill. Art is not found in seeing a semi-detached human head continue to bleed, the result of multiple gun shots. Whether practiced by street crooks or fawned-over Tarantino, serial killing is ghastly. When defended as art, it becomes ghastlier yet. I know there is a market for this type of horrific violence, and that's tragic. When your creative juices run dry, shoot a gun. That's Tarantino. That's this movie.`,
      `Quentin Tarantino is a case of arrested development at 12 who keeps on making revenge fantasy movies, my guess against bullies who picked on him as a child. This film is a combination of spaghetti western and blaxploitation. I know I am odds with others, but I don't find hearing the "N" word at least 100 times entertaining; watching two men fight to the death as "entertainment" (the hammer used to kill one of the two wrestlers); the murder of a black man by a pack of vicious dogs; constant whipping, etc., etc., etc. - and with all that said, my least favorite character, by far, was Django - he's supposed to be "hip" and manly and blah blah blah, but he's really just a despicable macho jerk. I was very disappointed by Leonardo Di Caprio's performance (I didn't see the last 40 minutes of the movie; I had enough of the constant violence). I get that others just love guns, violence, the "N" word, and find it oh so funny when the Klu Klux Klan can't see through their sheets (hilarious - not!) - I get that others just love violence against others. Let's see: Aurora, Newtown, Columbine, drone planes murdering innocent children, women and men in countries we are not at war with - hmmm - could there be a connection? A society in love with violence can't quite reconcile the kharmic blowback that inevitably occurs. Yes, this film is well-photographed; there is one interesting performance (Christoph Waltz); the music, while weird, has its moments - but that's it as far as I'm concerned. Tarantino is always infuriating. If he could get away from his adolescent revenge violent fantasies he clearly has a knowledge of film history and has the money to hire fine movie technicians. But this film is a complete waste of time and money. Did you really find all the violence "fun" to watch? It turned my stomach. Films I enjoyed had violent scenes in them but they did not glorify violence.`,
      `This is far from being as great as a lot of folks are saying. It's not a total piece of rubbish, but this is definitely not Tarantino at his best. Firstly let me just say, that the action isn't terribly well done. A couple of years back Tarantino thought hey, lets create shootout scenes that involve everyone dying in about the space of ten seconds. The first time he did this it was great. Now it feels like a joke we've seen too many times. Can't we have a prolonged action scene where the tension builds up and up? Secondly there are a lot of what are apparently minor flaws: Why does the woman (as Django shoots her at the end of the movie) fly off to the side as if pulled by a rope? Is it meant to look fake? If so why? I don't get it. Why introduce the mysterious character of the woman with the red bandanna across her face, only to have her disposed of in the space of ten seconds? Why does Shultz shoot Candie at a time when he knows it risks the girl's life? Seems out of character to me, since he has risked everything to save the girl. Also the Shultz character seems to be too closely akin to the character the same actor played in Inglorious Basterds (which I felt was a much better movie). Couldn't they come up with something more varied? And the Australians working for the mining company are utterly implausible. Did they somehow get teleported directly from outback Australia to Southern USA without losing one iota of their slang and dialect? I don't buy it. Anyway I could go on picking holes in this movie. But I'll leave it there.`,
      `I didn't see inglorious bastards cause it sounded bad, and morally warped. I didn't mind kill bill because while it was a revenge movie, there was no really sadistic pleasure taken in causing extra pain, in that sense, it was emotionally realistic. Also the suffering and the anguish of the thirst for revenge was portrayed. These two latest films of QT's glorify burning seething hatred, torture, pleasure in suffering (Inglorious and Django)- the worst kind of traits you can humanly empathise with. Every one who is killed is "a bad guy", but the "good guys" are also bad guys, in that they revel in the suffering of others (not just the deaths by the way). The difference is only in the backstory, character focus, and degree of sadism. This blurs moral lines in horrible ways, and tempts you into taking satisfaction and joy, not just in victory, but in human suffering. This is some sick stuff, and I am going to wait until QT stops making revenge movies, before I revisit his movies. They have lost all real human emotional qualities and all sense of moral compass. And BTW, its not that this film grossed me out, its that the main character had a real thing for blood and pain, and that was treated as just and right, not as an emotional curse/burden.`,
      `If you thought that Quentin Tarantino had gotten as hilariously ludicrous as possible with "Inglourious Basterds", wait 'til you see "Django Unchained". Based on a series of spaghetti westerns, it depicts a former slave looking for his wife...and getting revenge in the process. Jamie Foxx plays the title character whose unexpected acquaintance with a German dentist-turned-bounty hunter (Christoph Waltz) sets on a path to reunite with his beloved (Kerry Washington). Since this is a Tarantino movie, there's naturally a lot of graphic violence done in very good taste. But probably the most surprising thing is Leonardo DiCaprio's role. So far he's pretty much always played likable characters. Here his role is that of a deliciously evil plantation owner who has what appears to be an incestuous relationship with his sister. Equally impressive is Samuel L. Jackson's role as the house (N word). Not only does Jackson naturally use his common word - the one that graced his wallet in "Pulp Fiction" and dominated the famous line in "Snakes on a Plane" - but he turns the Uncle Tom character into someone who looks down on blacks as much as any slave-owner. Django, meanwhile, often gives everyone a soft stare while the bounty hunter leads the conversation. As is Tarantino's protocol, he gives a bunch of forgotten and/or retired stars supporting roles: Don Johnson and Bruce Dern play slave-owners; Dennis Christopher ("Breaking Away") plays an assistant; Ted Neeley ("Jesus Christ Superstar"), Robert Carradine ("Revenge of the Nerds") and Tom Savini (the famous makeup artist) play trackers; and Franco Nero (the original Django) plays a man who understands the pronunciation. Jonah Hill appears in the movie's funniest scene. It all adds up to one really good movie. So far Quentin Tarantino (who appears as a mining company employee) has not disappointed, and I'm very eager to see his next movie. You know that he'll do something neat. In the meantime, "Django Unchained" is one for the ages! If you haven't seen the original "Django", it's also worth seeing.`,
